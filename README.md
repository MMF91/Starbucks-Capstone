# Starbucks-Capstone

### Description
This project is part of Udaicty Data Science Nanodegree. The aim of the project is to leverage what we've learned throughout the program to build a data science project. I chose Starbucks capstone project:

The data sets contain simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. The data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.

My task is to use the data to answer the following questions:
* Customers:
  - Who are the cutomers that purchase with offers only?
  - who are the customers that fulfill offer conditions without using offers?
* Offers:
  - Which offers are most popular to offers only customers?
  - Which offers are less fulfilled by non offer users?

### Files:
- portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
- profile.json - demographic data for each customer
- transcript.json [compressed due to size limit] - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed 

- Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook that showcase work related.

### Results:
The main findings of the code can be found at [Starbucks Customers Behaviour with Offers](https://medium.com/@mawadamf91/starbucks-customers-behaviour-with-offers-179e8bcd5306) post.
